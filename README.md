# Mendix PhoneGap / Cordova hybrid app base package

This repository contains the core files needed to build a Phonegap package for your Mendix application.
It consists of two main parts:

- The core source files for the hybrid app
- The webpack configuration that is used during the build process

You should not use this package directly.
Instead, refer to the [Mendix PhoneGap / Cordova hybrid app template](https://github.com/mendix/hybrid-app-template/) for instructions on how to customize and build your Mendix hybrid mobile app.

## Building a templated Phonegap Build package

This project can be used to create a templated Phonegap Build package, as used within the Mobile Publish flow of the Mendix Portal.

```

## Mendix-specific forks of Cordova/Phonegap plugins

Mendix hybrid apps include a number of plugins by default.
These plugins have been created by the Cordova/Phonegap community.
For some of these plugins, we have created Mendix-specific forks.
The reason for creating a fork varies per plugin.
The list below outlines the details per forked plugin.
